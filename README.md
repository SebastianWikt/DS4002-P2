## Instructions for reproducing results
Running the code in the scripts folder will generate the plots and analysis that we used for our inferences in this project. 

- Install the necessary packages in R
- Clone this repository for access to the dataset (both cleaned data and original dataset).
- Read in and clean the data.
- Run the defined functions to reproduce data and graphs.
- Determine the correlation between the variables highlighted in the code from the dataset

Refer to comments throughout the code script in the Scripts folder for specific instructions that will guide you through reproducing our results (in MIL2-P2.Rmd and MIL2-P2.Pdf).
